# Remove-Recommended-From-Youtube
Script which uses the Tampermonkey extension to remove recommended videos from Youtube.

# To use it:
- Install Tampermonkey extension (I use it in Google Chrome).
- Go `Create new script`.
- Copy paste the script (`main.js`).
- Reload youtube and you should not see the recommendations!
- Feel free to modify anything you want in the code :).
- Enjoy!
